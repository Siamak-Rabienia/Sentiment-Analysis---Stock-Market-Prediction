# Introduction
In this mini project, I use the Sentiment Analysis to illustrate the impact of news headlines in overall trend of a particular Index/Security. This is an ongoing project and will be updated regularly.

# Analysis
I employ Python libraries like urllib.request (urlopen, Request) and bs4 (BeautifulSoup) for web scarping and extracting news headlines from finanial websites like finviz. To import stock quotes like closing price history, I use pandas_datareader and extract the financial data from yahoo finance. To calculate the sentiment scores( Polarity and Subjectivity) I use nltk.sentiment.vader (SentimentIntensityAnalyzer) and textblob (TextBlob) libraries.
